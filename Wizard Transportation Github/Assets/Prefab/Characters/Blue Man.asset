  initalDialogue: I hope you haven't seen my sworn enemy, the red dragon. He thinks
    he's so much cooler, but what he doesn't understand is that I am superior in
    every aspect. I'm incredibly flawless and skilled, while HE couldn't do anything
    ever. Back in the evil wars, me and him were actually side by side. This, of
    course, didn't last, since I was naturally better, and decided that I didn't
    need him.
